Testing Tensor Flow Algorithms (outdated). Simple example of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Algorithm using LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) in Python. 
Model predictions using order book data usinf short-term price movements.

TRAINING DATA:
*timestamp (simulated time in milliseconds)
*best_bid (best buy price)
*best_ask (best sell price)
*bid_volume (quantity available at best bid)
*ask_volume (quantity available at best ask)
*spread (difference between best ask and best bid)

Improvements/problems:
* Tested different Loss Functions: MAE seems to work better than MSE, as it is less sensitive to large outliers.
* Loss Function ~ 99.00 for 100 sequence length
